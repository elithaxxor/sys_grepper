## ⚠️ Warning

This tool deletes files from your system. While it has been designed with safety in mind:

- **Always backup important data before running cleanup operations**
- Review the logs after each operation
- Use caution when cleaning system directories

## 📊 Logs

All operations are logged to:
- `~/cleanup_logs/deletions.log`: Record of deleted files
- `~/cleanup_logs/operations.log`: Record of all operations performed
- `~/cleanup_logs/errors.log`: Record of any errors encountered
- `./cleanup_[timestamp].log`: A summary log in the current working directory for easy reference

## 🔍 How It Works

The System Cleanup Utility works by:

1. Detecting your operating system (Linux or macOS)
2. Identifying safe-to-clean directories specific to your OS
3. Analyzing disk usage before cleanup
4. Safely removing unnecessary files with appropriate permissions
5. Protecting sensitive system files from deletion
6. Providing detailed logs of all actions
